# Data Science Projects (Dataquest)

* [Analysing CIA Factbook Data Using SQLite](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/facebook) - Analysing a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth, which contains demographic information such as the population as of 2015, the annual population growth rate, the total land and water area, etc.
* [Analysing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/schools) - Analysing the data on New York City high school SAT scores as well as the demographics for each high school combined with other related information, such as graduation outcomes, Advanced Placement (AP) test results, etc.
* [Analysing Thanksgiving Dinner](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/thanksgiving) - Analysing the dataset containing 1,058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, such as their gender, income, and location. 
* [Answering Business Questions using SQL](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/chinook) - Analysing the Chinook database (available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc.) containing information about a fictional digital music shop, including the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers' purchases.
* [Finding the Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Product](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/new-coders) - Analysing the New Coders survey by FreeCodeCamp, which contains information on how thousands of people all around the world are learning to code, and why they are choosing to do so. The objective is to determine best markets to advertise an e-learning product.
* [Investigating Fandango's Movie Rating System](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/fandango) - In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analysed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest. This project analyses more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.
* [Kaggle Workflow](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/kaggle) - Exploring the data science workflow from ingesting and preprocessing data, exploring data, engineering new features, selecting models through to making a submission to Kaggle.
* [Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/bike-rentals) - Analysing detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day in Washington, D.C. and predicting the total number of bike rentals (casual + registered) using the linear regressing, decision tree and random forest algorithms.
* [Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/car-prices) - Predicting car prices with k-nearest neighbour regression trained on the dataset containing information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.
* [Predicting House Sale Prices](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/housing) - Predicting house sale prices using the linear regression algorithm trained on the Ames Housing dataset, which describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. It contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables involved in assessing home values.
* [Predicting the Stock Market](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/stock-market) - Predicting future stock prices using the linear regression algorithm trained on historical data on the price of the S&P500 Index.
* [Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/star-wars) - Exploring and analysing the Star Wars survey dataset containing demographic information as well as answers to the Star Wars film franchise-related questions.
* [Visualising Earnings Based On College Majors](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/college-majors) - Visualising the recent grad student data from the College Majors dataset (originally from the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series).
* [Visualising Gender Gap Across All College Degrees](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/gender-gap) - Visualising the dataset containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012 compiled and released by the Department of Education Statistics. The dataset is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.
* [Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/alexenriquent/dataquest/tree/master/jeopardy) - Exploring and analysing a dataset of 20,000 Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help a participant win.
